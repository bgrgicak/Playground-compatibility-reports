| one-call | Function convert_to_screen(), add_meta_box() was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>. Likely direct inclusion of <code>wp-admin/includes/template.php</code> in order to use <code>add_meta_box()</code>. This is very wrong. Hook the <code>add_meta_box()</code> call into the <code>add_meta_boxes</code> action instead.
