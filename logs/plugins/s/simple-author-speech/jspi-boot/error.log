  				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
  				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
  				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
  
  				The resulting URL should look like this:
  				https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename

    				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites
