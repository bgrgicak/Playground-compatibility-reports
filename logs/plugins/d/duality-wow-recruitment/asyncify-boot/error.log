    				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
    				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
    				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
    				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.

    				https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename
