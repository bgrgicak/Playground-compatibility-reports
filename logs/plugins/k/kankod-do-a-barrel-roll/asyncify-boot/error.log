[04-May-2025 05:58:25 UTC] PHP Warning:  "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"? in /wordpress/wp-content/plugins/kanban-gravity-forms/kanban-gravity-forms.php on line 553
[04-May-2025 05:58:25 UTC] PHP Notice:  Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>. Translation loading for the <code>kanban</code> domain was triggered too early. This is usually an indicator for some code in the plugin or theme running too early. Translations should be loaded at the <code>init</code> action or later. Please see <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-wordpress/">Debugging in WordPress</a> for more information. (This message was added in version 6.7.0.) in /wordpress/wp-includes/functions.php on line 6121
