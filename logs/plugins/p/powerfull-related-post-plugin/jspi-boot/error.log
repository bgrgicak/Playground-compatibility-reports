[10-May-2025 04:41:45 UTC] PHP Notice:  Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>. Translation loading for the <code>pt-elementor-addons</code> domain was triggered too early. This is usually an indicator for some code in the plugin or theme running too early. Translations should be loaded at the <code>init</code> action or later.
