  				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
  				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
  
  				The resulting URL should look like this:
  				https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename

    				Check if the URL is correct and the server is reachable.
    				If it is reachable, the server might be blocking the request.

    				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites
