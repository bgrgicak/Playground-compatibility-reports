Remove the \"/blob/\" part of the URL.\n    \n    \t\t\t\tThe resulting URL should look like this:\n    \t\t\t\thttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename\n    \n    \t\t\t\tError:\n    \t\t\t\tError: Could not download \"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/registrations-for-specific-domain.latest-stable.zip\"\n        at Ct.resolve (file:///home/runner/work/playground-tester/playground-tester/node_modules/@wp-playground/blueprints/index.js:1129:13)\n        at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)\n        at async _.run (file:///home/runner/work/playground-tester/playground-tester/node_modules/@php-wasm/util/index.js:45:14)\n  }\n}\n\n",
