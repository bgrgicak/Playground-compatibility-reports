    				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites
    				(cross-origin requests, or CORS).	You need to move the asset to a server that allows
    				cross-origin file downloads. Learn more about CORS at
    				https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS.
    
    				If your file is on GitHub, load it from "raw.githubusercontent.com".
    				Here's how to do that:
    
    				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
    				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
    				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
    				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
    
    				The resulting URL should look like this:
    				https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename
