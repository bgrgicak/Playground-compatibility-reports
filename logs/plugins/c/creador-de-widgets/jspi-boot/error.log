  				Check if the URL is correct and the server is reachable.

  				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites

  				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
  				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
  				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
