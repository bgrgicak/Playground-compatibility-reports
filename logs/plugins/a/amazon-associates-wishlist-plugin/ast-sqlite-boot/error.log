  				Check if the URL is correct and the server is reachable.

  				Check the browser console and network tabs for more information.

  				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites
  				(cross-origin requests, or CORS).	You need to move the asset to a server that allows

  				If your file is on GitHub, load it from "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				Here's how to do that:
  
  				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
  				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
  				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.

    				Check if the URL is correct and the server is reachable.
    				If it is reachable, the server might be blocking the request.
    				Check the browser console and network tabs for more information.

    				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites
    				(cross-origin requests, or CORS).	You need to move the asset to a server that allows
    				cross-origin file downloads. Learn more about CORS at
    				https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS.
    
    				If your file is on GitHub, load it from "raw.githubusercontent.com".
    				Here's how to do that:
    
    				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:
    				https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/filename.
    				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
    				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
    
    				The resulting URL should look like this:
    				https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/branch/filename
