  [cause]: Error: Error when executing the blueprint step #1 ({"step":"installPlugin","pluginData":{"resource":"wordpress.org/plugins","slug":"amoforms"},"options":{"activate":true}}) : 
  "unreachable" WASM instruction executed.
  
  The typical reason is a PHP function missing from the ASYNCIFY_ONLY
  list when building PHP.wasm.
  
  You will need to file a new issue in the WordPress Playground repository
  and paste this error message there:
  
  https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/new
  
  If you're a core developer, the typical fix is to:
  
  * Isolate a minimal reproduction of the error
  * Add a reproduction of the error to php-asyncify.spec.ts in the WordPress Playground repository
  * Run 'npm run fix-asyncify'
  * Commit the changes, push to the repo, release updated NPM packages
  
  Below is a list of all the PHP functions found in the stack trace to
  help with the minimal reproduction. If they're all already listed in
  the Dockerfile, you'll need to trigger this error again with long stack
  traces enabled. In node.js, you can do it using the --stack-trace-limit=100
  CLI option: 
  
      * php.wasm.__wrap_select
      * php.wasm.Curl_socket_check

    [cause]: Error: 
    "unreachable" WASM instruction executed.
    
    The typical reason is a PHP function missing from the ASYNCIFY_ONLY
    list when building PHP.wasm.
    
    You will need to file a new issue in the WordPress Playground repository
    and paste this error message there:
    
    https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/new
    
    If you're a core developer, the typical fix is to:
    
    * Isolate a minimal reproduction of the error
    * Add a reproduction of the error to php-asyncify.spec.ts in the WordPress Playground repository
    * Run 'npm run fix-asyncify'
    * Commit the changes, push to the repo, release updated NPM packages
    
    Below is a list of all the PHP functions found in the stack trace to
    help with the minimal reproduction. If they're all already listed in
    the Dockerfile, you'll need to trigger this error again with long stack
    traces enabled. In node.js, you can do it using the --stack-trace-limit=100
    CLI option: 
    
        * php.wasm.__wrap_select
        * php.wasm.Curl_socket_check
        * php.wasm.curl_multi_perform
        * php.wasm.zif_curl_exec
