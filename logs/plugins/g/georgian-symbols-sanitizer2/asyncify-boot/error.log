[11-May-2025 22:55:16 UTC] PHP Notice:  Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>. Translation loading for the <code>geoflex</code> domain was triggered too early. This is usually an indicator for some code in the plugin or theme running too early. Translations should be loaded at the <code>init</code> action or later. Please see <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-wordpress/">Debugging in WordPress</a> for more information.
