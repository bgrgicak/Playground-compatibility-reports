  				This means the server that hosts your file does not allow requests from other sites

  				Here's how to do that:
  
  				1. Start with the original GitHub URL of the file. For example:

  				2. Replace "github.com" with "raw.githubusercontent.com".
  				3. Remove the "/blob/" part of the URL.
